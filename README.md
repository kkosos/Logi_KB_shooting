In this game, your objective is to reach the goal, which is at some distance from the startpoint at the left side of the keyboard. The game field is on the '1','Q','A',and 'Z' rows, and the goal is marked by the lightened keys. There will be bullet waves preventing you from reaching the goal; three out of four rows will be randomly chosen each wave to shoot the bullet. Since once you are hit then the game is over, you have to dodge bullets and move forward to win. The keyboard will show a "FAIL"/"WIN" message after you lose/win the game. In particular, only one move toward right is allowed in a bullet wave, and it should be the last move for the wave(every move will be locked after that); however, the number of up/down/left move in a wave is not limited."# Logi_KB_shooting"
